!Purpose: Calculate localized PM mean of a 2D field.  Localized PM mean
!         uses all data in a non-exclusive calculation area to obtain
!         PM mean for a smaller patch within that region of dimensions
!         (patch_nx, patch_ny).  The size of the calculation area is
!         controled by the overlap variables ovx and ovy.  
!
!         Here is a diagram of the design:

!         This calculation is repeated for patches in the x- and y-direction
!         such that the entire domain is covered, and then a smoother is run
!         on the resulting field to ensure a smooth 2D output.  For best 
!         results, patch_nx and patch_ny of no larger than 8 are recommended.

                            !       Recommended value: 3 to 10 times patch_nx and patch_ny

                            !       areas of noise that can occur due to patch overlap.  For QPF,
                            !       filt_min = 0.1 mm for 3hr accumulated precip works well.

                            !       Recommended value = 2 (2 gridpoints) -- this needs some
