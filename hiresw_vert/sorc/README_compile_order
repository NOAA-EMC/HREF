1) Start with hiresw_wrfarwfcst.fd:  

Run the "compile_arw.sc" script in the main 
directory.  This WRF software build is used by
some other pieces, so should be done first.
It also is the most time consuming compilation, but
will build four executables and place them into the TARGDIR
of ../../exec/


2) hiresw_bucket.fd: Run the "compile" script to build the 
hiresw_pcpbucket_general executable that is placed in ../../exec/

3) hiresw_wrfbufr.fd: Run "make" to build hiresw_wrfbufr in ../../exec/

4) hiresw_post.fd: Run "make" to build hiresw_post in ../../exec/

5) hiresw_nmmbfcst.fd: Go to hiresw_nmmbfcst.fd/src/, and run the 
build.scr script.  The makefile run by this script should build
../../../exec/hiresw_nmmbfcst.

6) hiresw_nps.fd: Use the "build.scr" script in the hiresw_nps.fd/NPS/ directory.  
It will copy and properly rename the executables to a defined ${TARGDIR}
directory that should correspond to the exec directory within this 
vertical structure directory tree.  The hiresw_nps_ungrib and hiresw_nps_metgrid 
executables are built serial, while hiresw_nemsinterp is build as a parallel
executable.

7) hiresw_prdgen.fd: Run "make" to build hiresw_prdgen in the same 
../../exec/ directory

8) hiresw_sndp.fd: Run "make_all" to build  hiresw_sndp_arw and hiresw_sndp_nmmb 
in the ../../exec/ directory

9) hiresw_coldstart.fd: Run "make" to build hiresw_coldstart in the ../../exec/
directory

10) hiresw_smartinit.fd: Run "make" to build hiresw_smartinit in the ../../exec/
directory

11) hiresw_smartprecip.fd: Run "make" to build hiresw_smartprecip in the
../../exec/ directory

12) hiresw_wps.fd: Running the "build.scr" script should create the hiresw_ungrib and
hiresw_metgrid executables in ../../exec/  The configure.wps_serial defines where 
the need WRF model items are located.  It is specified as ../hiresw_wrfarwfcst.fd/, 
which should work properly in the provided directory tree.
