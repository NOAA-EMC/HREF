A change is made to have the soil depths are defined in the postprocessing code for the NMM member of HiresW.

Currently the fields are mislabeled by the postprocessing code, and thus aren't visible to the prdgen code that is seeking the properly labeled fields when interpolating to the final output grid.  Thus the soil temperature and soil moisture fields aren't currently being output by the NMM.

The additional fields may benefit forecasters and model developers, but the impact will be small.

GRIB file sizes from the NMM member of HiresW will increase by roughly 1.3% as two additional fields will be generated.

Effectively none, as the code change is very minor and limited in scope.
