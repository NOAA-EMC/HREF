The build.scr script will copy the appropriate configuration file to configure.wps, 
and then runs compile to build the two needed programs that are copied to
../../exec/hiresw_ungrib and ../../exec/hiresw_metgrid

The "clean" script will remove contents from a previous build, with a "clean -a" doing
a thorough cleaning.
