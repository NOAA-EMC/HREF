up the needed updates.

----------------------

Changes intended to go in with the RAPv3 upgrade.  Both changes are needed to allow
the HiresW to work with RAP GRIB2 files.

Update details (6.1.9 to 6.1.10):

Modifies parm/hiresw_Vtable.RAP to account for GRIB2 RAP files

Modifies scripts/exhiresw_prelim_rap.sh.ecf to modify the filename for the RAP
file processed by the job (now with a .grib2 terminator).
