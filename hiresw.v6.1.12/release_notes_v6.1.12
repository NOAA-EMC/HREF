v6.1.12 - Released October 14, 2016

Check out https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/hrw/tags/hiresw.v6.1.12/ to pick
up the needed updates.

Changes are intended to go in whenever the NAM/RAP/SREF also change their
BUFR station lists

----------------------

Update details (6.1.11 to 6.1.12):

Modifies fix/hiresw_ak*_profdat and fix/hiresw_conus*_profdat files, 
adding a few new stations, and changing the locations of some others.

Just adopting the four updated profdat files will enact the change; 
no code changes are required.

Technical details of system usage:

Unchanged from 6.1.11.  In theory the code should run slightly slower as it is 
processing more stations, but tests with the old and new profdat files didn't
show a measurable slowdown.
