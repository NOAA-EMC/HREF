v6.0.10 - released June 23, 2014
 
Converts the NAM latitudes and longitudes from radians to degrees (if needed) 
in the coldstart job.  The coming NAM implementation will require this fix.
Can be run immediately with current operational NAM.

- Minor code change to one routine in hiresw_coldstart.fd

- Should have no impact on timing, file sizes, etc.


Implementation instructions:

This update contains a code modification in sorc/hiresw_coldstart.fd

Rebuild the code with a "make" command in that directory.

New executable hiresw_coldstart will be placed in ../../exec/
