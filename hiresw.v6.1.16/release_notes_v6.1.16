Update details:

 Note: used ops v6.1.14 was the starting point. 

THEN

- Added the script changes for NAMv4 (previously delivered as my v6.1.13).  Expectation is that these changes
will be in operations before this package gets implemented with the GFS.

- Modified two parm files to properly handle the coming 2017 GFS GRIB data.  Now that the ARW
is properly reading snow data, the 2017 GFS data became problematic based on how the snow field was being
interpolated.  A test of the Guam domain also revealed issues with soil fields in the NMMB.  Changes
to the parameter files controlling interpolation of input data fixes both problems.
