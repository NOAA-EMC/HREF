up the needed updates.

----------------------

Fixes a problem with the initial snow in the WRF-ARW member, correcting a warm bias issue over snow cover.

Fixes a bug that led to the NMMB model failure for the 00Z cycle on 1 January 2017.  

Update details (6.1.12 to 6.1.15):

** Note: the ops v6.1.12 was the starting point.  This version DOES NOT include v6.1.13 changes for NAMv4.

Several items slightly changed in the ARW model code:

sorc/hiresw_wrfarwfcst.fd/dyn_em/module_wps_io_arw.F (read snow and set flags appropriately)
sorc/hiresw_wrfarwfcst.fd/dyn_em/module_initialize_real.F (just adds prints to make clear how snow is being processed).
sorc/hiresw_wrfarwfcst.fd/dyn_em/depend.dyn_em (forces more recompilation if module_wps_io_arw.F is modified).

Two line change for the NMMB filter issue fix in:

sorc/hiresw_nmmbfcst.fd/src/atmos/nmm/module_NMM_INTEGRATE.F90 

Unrelated to either are modifications to the module file to get around compilation issues I had with the v6.1.7 one in the ops code:
