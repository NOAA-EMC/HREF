v1.1.0 - released October 22, 2015

Check out https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/hrw/tags/href.v1.1.0/

Load the contents of the modulefile modulefiles/HREF/v1.1.0

Running the script sorc/build_href.scr will load the HREF modulefile
and make the single HREF executable: href_ensprod

Update details:

Primary change is to add the generation of NAWIPS/GEMPAK products from the 
HREF.  This adds a new job (JHREF_GEMPAK) and script.  It could be 
triggered at the end of the HREF product generation job (JHREF_ENSPROD).  

Fixes a bug in the time labeling of accumulated precipitation for non-00Z cycles.

Cleans up some scripts, deleting some commented out lines from when time looping was done
in USH scripts.

The new JHREF_GEMPAK job runs on a single task in roughly 15-20 minutes.

Output is directed to /com2/nawips/${envir}/href.${PDY}

Four cycles of the new GEMPAK output is roughly 8.4 GB/day of additional storage on disk

v1.0.2 - released June 19, 2015

Installation details:

Check out https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/hrw/tags/href.v1.0.2/

Load the contents of the modulefile modulefiles/HREF/v1.0.0

Running the script build_href.scr will load the HREF modulefile (assuming it is visible in $MODULEPATH) 
and make the single HREF executable: href_ensprod

Update details:

Includes a code change to sorc/href_ensprod.fd/sref_ens_gen.f to account for the different
sized bitmaps, and limiting output to the minimum region for which all source models
have valid data.

v1.0.1 - released April 23, 2015

Installation details:

Check out https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/hrw/tags/href.v1.0.1/

Load the contents of the modulefile modulefiles/HREF/v1.0.0

Running the script build_href.scr will load the HREF modulefile (assuming it is visible in $MODULEPATH) 
and make the single HREF executable: href_ensprod

Update details:

Includes Xiaoxue's redesign so the looping over time is done at a high level, making it a
clean single job.  Also cleans up certain script items.

Update details:

* A new High Resolution Ensemble Forecast (HREF) suite of products is
introduced.  Despite using the same name, this product has very little in common with
the HREF output previously provided by HiresWindow v5.  

This new HREF is a set of probabilistic products generated from the three most 
recent HiresW runs (3 WRF-ARW runs, 3 NMMB runs) and the five most recent 
NAM nest runs. In this initial implementation, products are generated only for the CONUS
domain.

The HREF is run every 6 h (00Z, 06Z, â€¦).   Mean, spread, and probability products are produced every 3 h to 36 h.

Output is placed in /com/hiresw/prod/href.${PDY}/ensprod/

Mean (href.t${cyc}z.mean.f${ff}.grib2) and spread (href.t${cyc}z.sprd.tf${ff}.grib2) field file contents:

500 hPa height
850 hPa height, temperature, U and V winds, and wind speed
700 hPa vertical velocity and relative humidity
500 hPa absolute vorticity
Precipitable water (column total)

cloud ceiling height
surface vertical speed shear

The JHREF_RUNALL job runs serially on a single task, but submits two six node jobs.  These six node jobs run in roughly 12-20 minutes.  Timings seemed quite variable in testing, but this system is I/O intensive so may be more sensitive than most to filesystem activity.  In theory it could be redesigned to run on fewer nodes for a longer time.  Each node currently is processing just a single hour of forecast time, so each hour is independent making the system flexible.

Approximate 580 mb of GRIB2 output per cycle time is sent to /com/hiresw/${envir}/href.${PDY}/ensprod/

So if four cycles per day are run, roughly 2.3 GB/day will be added to /com/.
