# HREF

Contains the workflow and codes and other files needed to run the High Resolution Ensemble Forecast (HREF) system.  

Very simple setup instructions (just for WCOSS2):

cd href.v3.1.0/sorc/

./build_href.sh 

./install_href.sh (to copy executables to exec/)

./link_href_fix.sh  (to populate fix files)
