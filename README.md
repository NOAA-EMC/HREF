# RRFS_ENSPOST

Contains the workflow and codes and other files needed to run the Rapid Refresh Forecast System (RRFS) enspost.  

Very simple setup instructions (just for WCOSS2):

cd rrfs.v1.0.0/sorc/

./build_enspost.sh 

./install_enspost.sh (to copy executables to exec/)

./link_enspost_fix.sh  (to populate fix files)
