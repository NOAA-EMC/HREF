Implementation instructions
---------------------------

After the tag is checked out, two executables should be rebuilt.

1) Go to sorc/hiresw_wrfbufr.fd/

"make" will build the executable as ../../exec/hiresw_wrfbufr by default.

2) Go to sorc/hiresw_nmmbfcst.fd/src/

Running "./build.scr" will build the executable as ../../../exec/hiresw_nmmbfcst
by default.
